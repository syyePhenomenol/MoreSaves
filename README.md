# MoreSaves
A mod for hollow knight that allows "infinite" pages of saves

Use the in game controls to goto previous pane and next pane to change save pages

The default binds are \[ and \] but they can be changed in the ingame menu (which can be found in `Options > Mods > MoreSaves Settings`)

* Other features in the in-game menu include:
    * add the ability to edit most values in save files
    * Change keybinds to go to the next/previous page
    * Add/remove pages
    * Back up saves
    * Restore saves
    * Rename save files
    * Lock save files (remove the clear button)

Note: Editing save you are currently in, now actually takes effect in game.
